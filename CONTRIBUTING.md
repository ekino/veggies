## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help.
They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please **ask first** if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for veggies.
Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

Please also provide a **test plan**, i.e. specify how you verified that your addition works.

## Updating README.md
